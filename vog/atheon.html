		<h2>Overview ðŸ”¥</h2>
		<p><b>Goal: Defeat Atheon.</b></p>
		<p>In this encounter, you will be defeating Atheon, Timeâ€™s Conflux. 
		There will be a wave of ad clear before the mechanics begin. After 
		a while, Atheon will raise his hand and teleport half of the fireteam 
		into either Venus or Mars. <b> Make sure to call out where you spawn 
		as soon as you get teleported.</b> People that didnâ€™t get teleported 
		should stand in the plate that was called.  For instance, if Mars was 
		called, move to the left plate. When you get teleported, have someone
		pick up the relic and move down the stairs to the middle of the room. People 
		in the main room will call oracles in a certain order again and the people that 
		got teleported will shoot the oracles called. Clear the ads (shielded minotaurs will 
		spawn again and relic holder must kill them). Repeat this for a total 
		of 3 waves of oracles. Once the last wave is called, the people who got 
		teleported run through the activated portal and join everyone else for 
		DPS. Rinse and repeat until Atheon is defeated.</p>
		<p><b>Static Challenge: No one on the fire team can kill a supplicant.</b></p>

		<h2>Tips/Tricks/Loadout Recommendations</h2>
		<h3>Normal Mode</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There will be flying harpies, leave one of them alive so that more won't spawn.</li>
			<li>There will be supplicants. Stand on the block that is on each plate to avoid them.</li>
			<li>The room where people get teleported into is the EXACT same as the main room. You just spawn
			at the top of the stairs instead. Re-orient yourself so that you can see the oracles in the same
			way as the team in the main room does.</li>
			<li>People that get teleported will be Marked by the void and must have the relic holder cleanse
			by blocking with the relic and standing inside the circle.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>After the third wave of oracles is cleared, the relic holder should
				stand near the portal and cleanse the other two as they go through the portal.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Atheon DPS will be primarily from super chaining.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Celestial Nighthawk with bottom tree gunslinger for hunters.</li>
				<li>Alternatively, tether can generate orbs from ads on the side.</li>
				<li>Titans use thundercrash with Cuirass of the Falling Star.</li>
				<li>1 warlock on well of radiance is optimal. This person will also hold the relic during DPS phase.</li>
				<li>Other warlocks can go nova bomb or chaos reach.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Useful weapons</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Xenophage for one-shotting oracles.</li>
				<li>Anarchy for sustained damage.</li>
				<li>Deathbringer if you don't have super energy.</li>
				<li>Scout Rifles to kill the harpies.</li>
				<li>Sniper Rifles as an alternative for oracles.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h3>Static Challenge</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Everything is the same except the people in the main room must try to bait the supplicants into
			blowing themselves up.</li>
			<li>Get close then when they start the animation to blow up, jump away.</li>
		</ul>
