			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p><b>Goal: Defeat Atheon.</b></p>
			<p>In this encounter, you will be defeating Atheon, Time’s Conflux. 
			There will be a wave of ad clear before the mechanics begin. After 
			a while, Atheon will raise his hand and teleport half of the fireteam 
			into either Venus or Mars. <b> Make sure to call out where you spawn 
			as soon as you get teleported.</b> People that didn’t get teleported 
			should stand on the plate that was called.  For instance, if Mars was 
			called, move to the left plate. When you get teleported, have someone
			pick up the relic (which will be there as soon as you teleport in) and move down the stairs to the middle of the room. People 
			in the main room will call oracles in a certain order again and the people that 
			got teleported will shoot the oracles called. Clear the ads (shielded minotaurs will 
			spawn again and relic holder must kill them). Repeat this for a total 
			of 3 waves of oracles. Once the last wave is called, the people who got 
			teleported run through the activated portal and join everyone else for 
			DPS. During damage phase, one player will get a debuff called Detained (it will show up as the first thing on the left side of your screen.
			Call out that you are being detained and run away from the team. Run towards atheon so that everyone can see you and shoot you out of the detainment bubble easier.
			Rinse and repeat until Atheon is defeated.</p>
			<p><b>Static Challenge</b>: No one can deal damage to a supplicant.</p>
			<p><b>Rotating Challenge</b>: Each person shoots an oracle per wave (including the relic holder).</p>
			<p><b>Master Mode</b>: Harpies have arc shields. Inisde the portals will have <b>Anti-barrier hob-goblins</b>. Atheon hits harder.</p>

			<h2>Tips/Tricks/Loadout Recommendations</h2>
			<h3>Normal Mode</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>There will be flying harpies, leave one of them alive so that more won't spawn.</li>
				<li>There will be supplicants. Stand on the block that is on each plate to avoid them.</li>
				<li>The room where people get teleported into is the EXACT same as the main room. You just spawn
				at the top of the stairs instead. Re-orient yourself so that you can see the oracles in the same
				way as the team in the main room does.</li>
				<li>You can stand in the middle of the room, on the floating platform in the middle, or in the back of the room.</li>
				<li>People that get teleported will be Marked by the void and must have the relic holder cleanse
				by blocking with the relic and standing inside the circle.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>After the third wave of oracles is cleared, the relic holder should
					stand near the portal and cleanse the other two as they go through the portal.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Atheon DPS will be primarily from super damage.</li>
				<li>You can also run divinity with linears (as of Season 18 meta).</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Celestial Nighthawk with bottom tree gunslinger for hunters.</li>
					<li>Titans use thundercrash with Cuirass of the Falling Star.</li>
					<li>1 warlock on well of radiance is optimal. This person will also hold the relic during DPS phase.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Relic holder can do damage by shooting something with auto-loading or something with damage over time.</li>
						<li>If they are a warlock, they can also use fusion grenades.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Other warlocks can go nova bomb or chaos reach.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Useful weapons</li>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/1395261499/xenophage/" target="_blank">Xenophage</a> for one-shotting oracles.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/2376481550/anarchy/" target="_blank">Anarchy</a> for sustained damage.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/2232171099/deathbringer/" target="_blank">Deathbringer</a> if you don't have super energy.</li>
					<li>Scout Rifles to kill the harpies.</li>
					<li>Sniper Rifles as an alternative for oracles.</li>
					<li>Linear fusion rifles + <a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/4103414242/divinity/">divinity</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>For the static challenge, people in the main room try to bait supplicants into blowing themselves up by getting close then jumping away once their 
					explosion animation starts.
				</li>
				<li>For the rotating challenge, </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Master Mode</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Standing at the back of the room (where there is a lot of cover) makes this encounter really easy.</li>
				<li>There is a strategy to force who gets teleported where 3 people die at the beginning then once the 3 who are alive get teleported, they can self ressurect.</li>
				<li>As soon as the third set of oracles are called, people outside should prep for damage right outside the portal (just be careful of atheon).</li>
				<li>Detain can still run towards atheon because even if atheon stomps, once you are detained you won't take damage from the stomp. 
					You can also just run off to the side but still in front so that everyone can shoot u and still do damage.
				</li>
			</ul>
