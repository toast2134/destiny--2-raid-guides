		<h2>Overview ðŸ”¥</h2>
		<p><b>Goal: Defend the confluxes from the vex.</b></p>
		<p>In this encounter, you will be defending confluxes that can 
		spawn in 3 different locations from the vex that will try to 
		sacrifice once they get near it. There will be 3 waves with 
		confluxes spawning in different set locations as indicated in 
		the map below. After a wave is cleared, the confluxes will go 
		away, and the next wave of confluxes will spawn after a short 
		period of time. The first wave of confluxes will spawn in the 
		middle. The second wave of confluxes will spawn on the left and 
		right sides. The third and last wave of confluxes will spawn in 
		all 3 locations. Once the third wave is cleared, the encounter 
		will be over.</p>
		<p><b>Static Challenge: Destroy the wyverns with supers. (must be final blows)</b></p>

		<h2>Tips/Tricks/Loadout Recommendations</h2>
		<h3>Normal Mode</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There will be Overload Minotaurs that will spawn periodically. 
			Make sure you kill these guys.</li>
			<li>It is recommended to assign 2 people per side as ads will 
			still keep spawning even if a conflux isn't there.</li>
			<li>Prioritize the Wyverns as those are the ones with the most 
			health and will do the most damage.</li>
			<li><b>Beware of the fanatics.</b> They will drop pools which 
			will mark you for negation and will kill you if you don't cleanse in the middle plate.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>It is advised to make sure that no one else has been 
				marked for negation before you cleanse so that you and your 
				teammate can cleanse at the same time.</li>
				<li>To cleanse, there is a plate in the middle that you must 
				run through at relatively the same time as your teammates if 
				they are also marked for negation.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Anything that can kill red bar enemies is useful here.</li>
			<li>Once again, grenade launchers with blinding grenades are very useful here.</li>
			<li>One time use supers are amazing here, such as blade barrage for hunters or 
			thundercrash for titans.</li>
			<li>Chaos Reach works really well for warlocks as well.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Static Challenge</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The most effective way to kill wyverns with super is to 
			bring them down to low health with your weapons then to kill 
			them with your super.</li>
			<li><b>The final blow MUST be from your super.</b></li>
			<li>Otherwise the encounter is the same.</li>
		</ul>
