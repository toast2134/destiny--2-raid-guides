		<h2>Overview ðŸ”¥</h2>
		<p><b>Goal: Shoot the oracles in the correct order.</b></p>
		<p>In this encounter there will be oracles that are glowing yellow boxes 
		that will spawn throughout the map in a certain order. They will spawn 
		in 7 different locations in 5 different waves. The first wave will have 
		3 oracles. The second wave will have 4 oracles. The third wave will have 
		5 oracles. The fourth wave will have 6 oracles. The fifth and final wave 
		will have all 7 oracles spawn. You must shoot the oracles in the correct 
		order that they appear in. They will reveal the pattern <b>TWICE</b> before 
		you can shoot them for each wave. Once the fifth wave is cleared, the encounter is over.</p>
		<p><b>Static Challenge: Do not kill the hob-goblins on the side of the arena.</b></p>

		<h2>Tips/Tricks/Loadout Recommendations</h2>
		<h3>Normal Mode</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I heavily recommend assigning everyone to an oracle.</li>
			<li>It is recommended to have L1 and L2 handled by the same person.</li>
			<li>Call out the oracles in the order that they spawn.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>For instance, if L3, R2, then Middle oracles spawn. The person at 
				L3 calls 1, the person at R2 calls 2, and the person at Middle calls 3.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Xenophage can one shot the oracles.</li>
			<li>Shotguns are also really nice here if you don't have xenophage.</li>
			<li>Anything long range such as a sniper rifle to deal with hob-goblins.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Static Challenge</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The encounter is the same except that you have to stay in cover so as to not get shot by the hob-goblins</li>
			<li>Defensive supers such as well of radiance or titan bubble are very useful here.</li>
		</ul>
