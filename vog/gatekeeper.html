		<h2>Overview ðŸ”¥</h2>
		<p><b>Goal: Defend the spires in both portals.</b></p>
		<p>In this encounter you will be defending confluxes, one inside of 
		the left portal and one inside the right portal in the main room. The 
		left portal is called Mars (since the terrain inside is like a desert) 
		and the right portal is called Venus (since the terrain inside is more 
		jungle-like, which is what Venus looked like in Destiny 1). Start by clearing 
		the ads and killing the gatekeeper hydra. Send one person into each portal 
		and have someone else that is outside of the portals pick up the relic. 
		There will be waves of vex that will try to sacrifice themselves just 
		like in the confluxes encounter. As you defend the conflux, there will 
		be shielded minotaurs that spawn. The shields must be broken by the 
		relic holder. When the first minotaur spawns, call out which side and 
		have the initial relic holder go into the corresponding portal. Whenever 
		someone brings the relic through a portal, they will have a debuff that 
		wonâ€™t let them go through another portal for 45 seconds called Teleport Destabilized. 
		Once the relic holder kills the minotaur, they must swap weapons to drop the relic 
		so that the other person can pick it up. Once the person inside the portal comes out, 
		they will drop the relic so that someone else can take it to the opposing portal. 
		Repeat until 6 minotaurs are cleared. Then there will be a final stand in the center 
		of the main room where you must defend the final conflux. Prioritize the shielded 
		minotaurs and wyverns. After everything is dead, the encounter will be over.</p>
		<p><b>Static Challenge: Kill the shielded minotaurs with the relic's super ability.</b></p>

		<h2>Tips/Tricks/Loadout Recommendations</h2>
		<h3>Normal Mode</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There will be overload minotaurs.</li>
			<li>Once you stand on the plate, you don't have to keep standing on it.</li>
			<li>Kill gatekeepers as soon as they spawn.</li>
			<li>Blinding grenade launchers with anarchy are very nice for this encounter.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>You can push back the minotaurs if you blind them. (Just run into them)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>You can freeze the minotaurs if the relic holder is falling behind by using stasis
			or by using Salvation's Grip</li>
			<li>Wyverns will spawn so using burst supers such as blade barrage or thundercrash is recommended.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Static Challenge</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Freezing the minotaurs and pushing the minotaurs back with blinding grenade launchers is crucial here.</li>
			<li>Let the relic holder kill as many ads as they can to build up their super energy faster.</li>
			<li><b>NOTE: </b>The relic holder should NOT try to challenge the wyverns as they WILL one shot you.</li>
			<li>The relic super USUALLY one shots the shielded minotaurs. If it doesn't for you, hit
			the minotaur with a single shield bash then use the super. Alternatively, jump into the air and use the super.</li>
		</ul>
