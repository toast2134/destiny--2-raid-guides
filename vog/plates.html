		<h2>Overview ðŸ”¥</h2>
		<p><b>Goal: Defend the plates until the spire in the back is built.</b></p>
		<p>This is the starting encounter that you load straight into. 
		It will start as soon as you load in, so it is important to 
		coordinate roles beforehand. There is a left plate, a right 
		plate, and a middle plate. As such, 2 people will be assigned 
		per plate. You must stand on the plate for it to be fully 
		charged, then defend the plate from the onslaught of minotaurs, 
		cyclopes, goblins, harpies, and hob-goblins. <b>Prioritize the 
		minotaurs as those will attempt to recapture the plate.</b> 
		Once the team has defended the plates for long enough, the spire
		will be complete and the door in the middle will open.</p>
		<p><b>Static Challenge: None.</b></p>

		<h2>Tips/Tricks/Loadout recommmendations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You don't need to stand on the plates once they are 
			fully charged. They will remain fully charged until a 
			minotaur steps inside of it.</li>
			<li>It is very easy to spawncamp the spawns as you can see 
			where they will spawn.</li>
			<li>Kill the cyclops that will occasionally spawn after 
			you've made sure to kill the minotaurs.</li>
			<li>Grenade launchers with blinding grenades are very nice here</li>
			<li>Salvager's Salvo (with the chain reaction perk selected) 
			is very nice here</li>
			<li>The minotaurs have void shields so any weapons with a 
			void element can help kill them faster</li>
			<li>Roaming supers are the best for ad clear, but defensive 
			supers such as well of radiance and bubble can help too.</li>
