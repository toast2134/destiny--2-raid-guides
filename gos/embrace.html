            <h2>Overview</h2>
			<p><b>Goal: Stay alive and clear ads.</b></p>
            <p>This encounter introduces the main mechanic throughout the raid: the tether. The tether basically links you from the source
            to either a player or the end, as indicated with a white line. The tether has a certain distance though, which is indicated once it becomes
            <b>red</b> as you move farther away from the source. In this encounter, the fireteam will split into two teams of 3. One team will be "Go" team, 
            while the other is "stay" team. The encounter kind of plays out like leap-frog. Stay team will stay at the beginning with the boss.
            Go team will tether from the floating box somewhere near the right side of the starting 
            room to the plus sign right in front of that door. This starts the encounter. Go team will go forward until they see the next door, where they will kills ads until
            they can tether to open the door again. At this point, the boss will teleport from the starting room to where go team is. Go team sits with the boss while stay team catches up to where Go
            team is, <b>but stay team moves on</b> to the next room. They clear ads and tether to open the door. Repeat until you get to the very top at the end. At this point, there will be three boxes
            to tether at a door. Unlock all three of these and you basically just run and pick up the goop (explained in next paragraph).</p>
            <p>When a team is staying with the boss, they must pay attention to the boss while clearing ads. The boss will move away occasionally, and drop a some goop on the ground that is glowing and 
            looks chaotic. Only one person can pick this up at a time (you run though it). If multiple people pick up this buff simulaneously, it will kill everyone who picked it up at the same time. You
            <b>MUST</b> pick this up though, otherwise it will wipe once the goop explodes. Once you run though the goop, it will give you a debuff called <b>"Volatic Overflow"</b>. This means that you can't pick up the goop again
            until the timer is gone (the debuff just goes away).
            </p>
            <p><b>Static Challenge</b>: Only tether when you have the Voltaic Overflow Buff.</p>
            <p><b>Rotating Challenge</b>: Don't Kill Cyclopses.</p>

            <h2>Tips/Tricks/Loadout Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Having weapons to stun the overload champions is very nice here. Otherwise you can just burst them down.</li>
                <li>Typically, if "Go" team is fast enough, then the boss will only drop the goop twice (once if you're really speedy).</li>
                <li>Ad clear is good here, so weapons like <a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/814876685/trinity-ghoul/" target="_blank">Trinity Ghoul</a> work well here.</li>
                <li>You can extend picking up the goop to give "Go" team more time. Just wait about 3 seconds before running through.</li>
                <li>Burst supers like thundercrash are good for dealing with overloads.</li>
                <li>Once someone has picked up the voltaic overflow debuff, they can move onto the next room to help clear ads/tether.</li>
                <li>For the static challenge: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have go team stay to pick up their buffs to start.</li>
                    <li>The rotation should work to where three people will always have a debuff.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>For the rotating challenge, just dodge the cyclopses that spawn in.</li>
            </ul>
