            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><b>Goal: Defend the relays to summon the consecrated mind.</b></p>
			<p>This encounter introduces a new mechanic called the "Enlightened" Buff. Using the tether mechanic from last encounter, you tether from the floating boxes to the pillars. Once
			you tether, you will gain a buff called "Enlightened". Throughout the encounter, there will be vex with white shields that spawn. You must have the buff in order to shoot these shields off.</p>
			<p>This encounter is relatively simple once you get a rhythm. There are 6 roles (one for everyone on the team). There are 4 relay defenders and 2 floaters. Illustrated
			in the image below, there are 4 relays. Each person must get to their relay to defend it. As you go around clearing ads, there will be
			<b>anti-barier hob-goblins</b> as you go around. These only spawn initially. The 2 floaters will move between the relays to refresh people's "Enlightenment" buff. 
			After everyone is at a relay, hydras called "Angelics" will spawn at one of the four relays (there will be 3, one for each lane). Make sure to kill these whenever they spawn at a side. 
			After they spawn at each relay, the middle barriers
			will open up. There is a final relay in the middle where you do the same: tether to get the buff, kill the angelics, and kill the ads with the shields. After 3 waves, you will be done.</p>
            <p><b>Static Challenge</b>: You can't tether if you have the Englightened buff.</p>
            <p><b>Rotating Challenge</b>: Everyone has to tether around the same time.</p>

            <h2>Tips/Tricks/Loadout Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The key to floating is the <b>portals.</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>As shown in the picture, these portals link two relays.</li>
					<li>They will activate once you have tethered to that specific relay.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>There are several ways to call out the relays.</li>'
				<ul>
					<li>Starting at where the rally is, you go clockwise and count up from 1. So where the rally flag is 1.
					To the left is 2, diagonally across from 1 is 3, and to the right of 1 is 4.
					</li>
					<li>You can also think of this like American baseball, where the rally flag is home base.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>There are several ways to distribute everyone to each base. In general, one floater and the person who is staying
					at home base will stay at home base initially.
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>You can do the "drop off" method, where everyone else goes around to each base in a loop.</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Choose either left or right to go first.</li>
						<li>As you go, clear ads and tether at each location.</li>
						<li>Keep going until everyone has their relay.</li>
					</ol>
					<ul>
						<li>With this method, if someone needs a buff, the floater that stayed can take the portals to fill in as
							the other floater is getting ready for their rotations.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>You can do the "split" method (which tends to be faster).</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Have 2 people go left and 2 people go right.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The two people that go left, should be the one that stays at that relay, and one of the ones that will
								be going diagonally across (to the other side).
							</li>
							<li>This is the same with right side.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>After each side does their thing, the two people meet up on the far side.</li>
						<li>After everyone is set up at a relay, you can get your rhythm and Enlightenment buffs timed.</li>
					</ol>
				</ul>
				<li>It is important to be fast to clear each relay.</li>
				<li>You only have to kill the Angelics since they will lock the tether box.</li>
				<li>As you're setting up, you can leave the antibarriers to whoever is staying (especially if you need more time).</li>
				<li>Anti-barrier weapons like <a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/2130065553/arbalest/" target="_blank">Arbalest</a>
				can help kill the Angelics.</li>
				<li>For the static challenge, since the team is already sort of split into two teams of 3 (1 floater + 2 relay defenders), you
					just need to time your buffs with your "team".
				</li>
				<li>For the rotating challenge, make sure everyone can tether, then just count down. Keep in mind that <b>everyone can take portals</b>,
				not just the floaters.</li>
